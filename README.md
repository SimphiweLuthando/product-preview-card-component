## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow 

### What I learned

Building a product preview card component using HTML, CSS, and SCSS required me to use a mobile-first workflow. This meant that I needed to design the component with the constraints of a small mobile screen in mind, and then progressively enhance the design for larger screens. I learned that using a mobile-first approach helps ensure that the component is accessible and performs well on all devices. I also learned the importance of using SCSS, a CSS preprocessor, to write more efficient and maintainable styles. Overall, building the product preview card component taught me how to effectively design and develop a responsive and scalable web component.

### Continued development

There are a few areas that I want to continue focusing on in future projects. First, I want to continue improving my skills in HTML and CSS, particularly in regards to layout and responsive design. I also want to focus on improving my understanding of JavaScript and becoming more proficient in using it to build interactive and dynamic web components. Additionally, I want to continue learning about best practices for performance optimization, accessibility, and security in web development. Finally, I want to explore using modern frameworks and libraries, such as React and Vue, to streamline my development process and build more complex and scalable applications.
